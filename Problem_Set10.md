# MGJW Problem set 10

## Kahoot
Let's test what we learnt last session [here]().

## Updated Knowledge Map
Please bring with you the updated knowledge map printed on a piece of paper.

## Phylogenetics
* Donwload these 11 genomes.
```
GCA_900475805.1
GCA_900475305.1
GCA_900475515.1
GCA_019454385.1
GCA_019456615.1
GCA_024703115.1
GCA_001255215.1
GCA_026683915.1
GCA_026683935.1
GCA_020097335.1
GCA_002076835.1
```
* All these genomes belong to one species, find a way to know which species it is.
* Use a reference-based tool to align 10 genomes to this reference `GCA_002076835.1` that you just downloaded.
* Clean the core SNP alignment file.
* Build a phylogenetic tree from the cleaned core SNP alignment file (Hint: Ascertainment bias correction needed).
* Upload the `.contree` on iTOL and add a Sequence Type (metadata) on the tree.
